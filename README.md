Login Authentication and Main Form Flow (C# WinForms)

This project demonstrates a simple structure where the user first logs in through an authentication form, and upon successful login, is redirected to the main form where all operations are performed.

🔐 Login Form

Collects username and password

Validates the credentials

Opens the main form if authentication succeeds

Shows an error message if credentials are invalid

🖥️ Main Form

Displays the application's main features

Contains user operations such as viewing, editing, or managing data

🔄 Flow Summary

Application starts → Login form appears

User enters credentials

If valid → Main form opens

If invalid → Error message shown

🎯 Purpose

To provide a clean and secure entry point before giving access to the main operations of the application.
